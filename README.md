# Accenture_Data_Analytics_and_Visualization

Delve into the dynamic world of data analytics and visualization with the Navigating Numbers virtual internship. This immersive program offers an in-depth exploration of data essentials, encompassing data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and storytelling.

## Introduction
Social Buzz is a rapidly expanding technology unicorn in need of swift adaptation to its large-scale global operations. Accenture is conducting a 3-month POC centered on the following objectives:

- An audit of big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- Analysis to find Social Buzz's top 5 most popular categories of content

## Task 1: Project Understanding
Quickly get up to speed with the business problem being addressed, project requirements and team alignment.

Read the brief from Social Buzz to:
- Understand the client and business problem at hand.
- Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
- Identify which tasks to focus on as a Data Analyst.

Read the internal stakeholders chart to better understand the roles & responsibilities of the team. As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with the analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
Modeling data to create valuable insights.

Read & understood the data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer the business question: Top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

Cleaned the data by:
- Removing rows that have values that are missing,
- Changing the data type of some values within a column, and
- Removing columns that are not relevant to this task.

Created a final data set by merging three features together: Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types data sets. Performed data modeling by merging the three data sets. Figured out the Top 5 performing categories aggregating the total scores by category.

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling
Brought the data to life and extracted valuable insights for the business. Built a PowerPoint presentation to organize the findings on Social Buzz's content performance. Charts that effectively illustrate the data analysis. Some of the interesting insights that were shared include
- How many unique categories are there?
- What was the month with the most posts?
- How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
